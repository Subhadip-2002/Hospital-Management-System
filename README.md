Hospital Management System 
Overview
This project showcases SQL commands used to implement a Hospital Management System (HMS) database. The primary objective of this project is to design, build, and manage a relational database to effectively store and handle information related to patients, doctors, nurses, appointments, treatments, and other hospital operations.

By using this database, hospital staff can efficiently manage data related to healthcare services, track patient information, appointments, billing, and more.

Features

Database Design: SQL commands to create, structure, and manage the hospital database.
Table Creation: SQL queries for defining tables for entities such as Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Billing, etc.
Data Manipulation: SQL statements for inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.
Queries: SQL queries to retrieve specific information like patient details, doctor schedules, appointment logs, billing history, etc.
Constraints: Implementation of primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to ensure database integrity.
Joins: SQL JOIN operations to connect multiple tables and retrieve complex data relationships.
Aggregations: SQL functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc., for generating reports and summaries.
Views and Stored Procedures: Use of views and stored procedures to simplify complex operations.
